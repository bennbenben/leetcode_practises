# Top 20 Programming questions asked in an interview (from [TECHGIG](https://content.techgig.com/hiring/20-most-frequently-asked-programming-interview-questions/articleshow/74608663.cms))

## 1. How is a bubble sort algorithm implemented?
<p>Bubble sort is implemented by comparing adjacent elements until the entire array is sorted. It needs one full pass to know that it's fully sorted</p>

```
def bubblesort(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        swapped = False
        for j in range(0, len(nums)-1-i):
            if nums[j] > nums[j+1]:
                nums[j], nums[j+1] = nums[j+1], nums[j]
                swapped = True
        # one pass has confirmed that elements are already in sorted place
        if swapped == False:
            break

```
## 2. How to print the first non-repeated character from a string?
<p>Create a hash map of the letters and its respective counts</p>
<p>Iterate through the hashmap and return where the count == 1</p>

[Leetcode Qn 387. First Unique Character in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/)

```
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        s_counts = {}
        
        for letter in s:
            if letter not in s_counts.keys():
                s_counts[letter] = 1
            else:
                s_counts[letter] += 1
        
        for key, val in s_counts.items():
            if val == 1:
                return s.index(key)
        return -1
```

## 3. How to find the first non repeated character of a given String?
<p>Same as above #2</p>

## 4. How do you find duplicate numbers in an array if it contains multiple duplicates?
<p>Create a counter's hash map and populate it: {number: count}</p>
<p>Then iterate through it. It count == 2, append the number to another list</p>
<p>Finally, return the list</p>

[Leetcode Qn 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/)

```
def findDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        nums_count = Counter(nums)
        output = list()
        for key, val in nums_count.items():
            if val == 2:
                output.append(key)
        return output
```

## 5. How do you remove duplicates from an array in place?
<p>Iterate through the array from idx 1 onwards while holding a left pointer</p>
<p>If nums[i] == nums[i-1]: assign the left pointer to nums[i] and increment left ptr by 1</p>

[Leetcode Qn 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

```
def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    left = 1
    
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            continue
        else:
            nums[left] = nums[i]
            left += 1

    return left
```

## 6. How are duplicates removed from an array without using any library?
<p>Create a counter dictionary of the array (after iterating and counting thru it)</p>
<p>Afterwards, iterate thru the dictionary. Run the list.remove method for x number of times</p>

## 7. How do you find the middle element of a singly linked list in one pass?
<p>Iterate from the first Node with slow and fast pointer. Slow += 1, fast += 2</p>
<p>while loop condition - if fast and fast.next:</p>

[Leetcode Qn 876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        fast, slow = head, head
        
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return slow
```

## 8. How do you check if a given linked list contains a cycle? How will you find initial node of the cycle?
<p>Use a hash set to store all the nodes (while iterating thru them). If encounter a Node that is in the hash set, then cycle exists</p>

[Leetcode 141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

        if not head:
            return False
        
        visited = set()
        curr_node = head
        
        while curr_node:
            if curr_node not in visited:
                visited.add(curr_node)
            else:
                return True
            
            curr_node = curr_node.next
        
        return False
```

## 9. How do you reverse a singly linked list without recursion?
<p>Initialize a None node, then iterate through the LL</p>
<p>Each time, reversing the node's pointer</p>

[Leetcode 206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev_node = None
        curr_node = head
        
        while curr_node:
            # Save pointers
            next_node = curr_node.next
            # Reverse pointers
            curr_node.next = prev_node
            # Update pointers

<p>Merge Sort is a stable and recursive sorting algorithm. It splits elements into individual ones before joining them back together (sorted)</p>
<p>Time complexity: O(nLogn)</p>
<p>Space complexity: O(n)</p>

[Leetcode 75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

```
def merge_sort(nums):
    if len(nums)>1:
        # Recursively split array into halves
        mid = len(nums)//2
        left = nums[:mid]
        right = nums[mid:]
        
        merge_sort(left)
        merge_sort(right)
        
        # merge portion
        i,j,k = 0,0,0
        
        while i<len(left) and j<len(right):
            if left[i] < right[j]:
                nums[k] = left[i]
                i += 1
                k += 1
            else:
                nums[k] = right[j]
                j += 1
                k += 1
        
        # transfer remaining elements in left into nums
        while i<len(left):
            nums[k] = left[i]
            k += 1
            i += 1
        
        # transfer remaining elements in right into nums
        while j<len(right):
            nums[k] = right[j]
            k += 1
            j += 1
```


## 14. How is a radix sort algorithm implemented?

## 15. How do you swap two numbers without using the third variable?
1. Use python in-built
```
x, y = 10, 20
print ("Before swapping: ")
print("Value of x : ", x, " and y : ", y)
x, y = y, x
print ("After swapping: ")
print("Value of x : ", x, " and y : ", y)
```
2. Use Add/Sub Operators
```
x, y = 10, 20
print ("Before swapping: ")
print("Value of x : ", x, " and y : ", y)
x = x + y
y = x - y
x = x - y
print ("After swapping: ")
print("Value of x : ", x, " and y : ", y)
```
3. Use Multiply/Divide Operators
```
x, y = 10, 20
print ("Before swapping: ")
print("Value of x : ", x, " and y : ", y)
x = x * y
y = x / y
x = x / y
print ("After swapping: ")
print("Value of x : ", x, " and y : ", y)
```

## 16. How do you design a vending machine?

## 17. Write a program to find prime factors of an integer?
<p>Initialize a variable prime = 2. Use a while loop to track if (nums > 1). Each time, if nums is divisible by prime, then execute it and track prime</p>
<p>Else, increment prime by 1</p>

```
def primeFactors(nums):
    prime = 2
    output = list()
    while nums > 1:
        if nums % prime == 0:
            nums = nums / prime
            output.append(prime)
        else:
            prime += 1
    return output
```

## 18. What is Depth First Search Algorithm for a binary tree?
## 19. Difference between a stable and unstable sorting algorithm?
<p>Mainly on how the algorithm treats equal (or repeated) elements</p>

![Snippet showing stable vs unstable sorting algos](https://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stable-vs-Unstable-1.png)

## 20. What is the difference between Comparison and Non-Comparison Sorting Algorithms?
<p>Comparison sorting algorithmns have a comparison operator - like smaller than or bigger than</p>
<p>Sorting algorithms that sort the data without comparing the elements are called non-comparison sorting</p>
